LuaModeling is a library of 3D modeling routines written using
the Lua language.

Rather than be wrappers on other libraries, it takes the approach
of directly implementing the code.  This is done to both increase 
the ease of porting the code to multiple platforms, and for ensuring
it can be run on embedded systems as well as the larger desktop
systems.
